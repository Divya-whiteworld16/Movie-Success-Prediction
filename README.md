# Movie-Success-Prediction
I used kraggel for dataset.
 
 
 #INTRODUCTION -Movies are the most convenient way to entertain peoples. However, only few movies get
higher success and are ranked high. Many movies are produces by the movie industry in a
year. A movie’s revenue depends on various components such as cast acting in a movie,
budget for the making of the movie, film critics review, rating for the movie, release year of
the movie, etc. Because of these multiple components there is no formula that helps us to
provide analysis for predicting how much revenue a particular movie will be generating.
However by analyzing the revenues generated by previous movies, a model can be built
which can help us predict the expected revenue for a particular movie. As we know in
today’s world the movie is one of the biggest source of entertainment and also for business
purposes. . To expend this business further we need the technology through which we can
predict the success rate of the movie. If we were able to predict the movie success rate in
the correct manner then it will be easy for the businessman to get higher profit from it and
also if the prediction shows the success rate is low of certain movie then it helps those
businessmen to improve the content of the movie so that they can get higher revenue from
it. Success rate of movies, models and mechanisms can be used to predict the success of a
movie.
